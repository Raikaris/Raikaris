- 👋 Hi, I’m @Raikaris!
- 👀 I’m interested in creating websites and applications for a community I'm in!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development using The Odin Project!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing atm! I'm still very early in learning front-end webdev skills so I'm not looking to join in on any projects at the moment outside of personal ones to help advance my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me; I'd prefer not to be messaged unless we already know each other or already share / collaborate on a project together! Thank you!
